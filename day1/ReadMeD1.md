## Java Training 

The Project Azuga Training contains the well modularized java files for different functionalities . These codes were written in training with CodeOps as day to day tasks and are uploded to the Github repository,so that they can be used for future references and will be availble for any updates and any suggestions from the people for project upgradation.

### Linux Command:
This project contains codes for linux command like: mv, Cd, Echo, Cp, rm, mkdir, rmdir, date, cat, Pwd, whoami, less, more, touch. That we can run using command line arguement.

- Linux-commands

#### What to do when the key got expired?

Answer: You have to generate new key from the same account you created during Weather API site.

#### What to do to get information for any other crypto currency?

Answer: In the place, where you put the url in the code, just put the name of the crypto which is listed in the crypto market, for eg in the place of polkadot one can put dogecoin to check the updates.
