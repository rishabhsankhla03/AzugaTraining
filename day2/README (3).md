# Java Training


The Project Azuga Training contains the well modularized java files for different functionalities . These codes were written in training with CodeOps as day to day tasks and are uploded to the Github repository,so that they can be used for future references and will be availble for any updates and any suggestions from the people for project upgradation

This project also contain codes in which I Implemented all the features of “ls” command: 
ls-a, ls-x, ls-r, ls-R, ls-m, ls-la, ls-1 etc. 

It contain codes that can mimic the behaviour, it don’t call the command itself from the program. I implemented all essential command-line options as possible.
